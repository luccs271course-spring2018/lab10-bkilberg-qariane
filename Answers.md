The breadth first priinted in order and have similar results to the first iterations
The result of the depth first are printed in reverse order compared to the results of the breadth first

### Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.
If there were a real-world map in which there were five countries, and four of those countries all touch each other as well as the fifth country (as the central country), then more than four colors would be needed for the map.

It is also possible that a country could be split up geographically, where part of the country is not touching the other part of the country. In this case, the two parts of the same country on the map should be colored the same. Since those two parts are bordering with other regions, each bordering with all the others, it may require more than four colors on the map.
